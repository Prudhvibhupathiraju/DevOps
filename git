version control

if you keep code in git, we can maintain history and we can get back to previous versions

Git -> content tracker

main/master --> points the code that is running in production

process to change the code
----------------------
-> create a copy of the file 
-> do the changes 
-> test the changes 
-> then merge the changes to the main file

create an another branch from main/master
-> do the changes here 
-> run CICD --> deploy in dev
-> test the application
-> merge into master -> deploy into production

Commit
-> commit is a command used to save changes in local repository

Local repository 
-> local repository is present on your computer where you make changes and commits 

Remote repository
-> Remote repository is present online platforms like github or servers
