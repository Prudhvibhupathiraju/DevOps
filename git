version control

if you keep code in git, we can maintain history and we can get back to previous versions

Git -> content tracker

main/master --> points the code that is running in production

process to change the code
----------------------
-> create a copy of the file 
-> do the changes 
-> test the changes 
-> then merge the changes to the main file

create an another branch from main/master
-> do the changes here 
-> run CICD --> deploy in dev
-> test the application
-> merge into master -> deploy into production

Commit
-> commit is a command used to save changes in local repository

Local repository 
-> local repository is present on your computer where you make changes and commits 

Remote repository
-> Remote repository is present online platforms like github or servers

Commit ID or SHA code is 40 characters universal unique ID to track the content in the git

If you change the content commit ID will change

Commit ID is same for same code universally

echo "Hello World" | git hash-object --stdin --> prints commit ID or SHA code (contains 40 characters universal unique ID for content)
git log -> displays history of commits in the repository
git cat-file <commit-ID> -p -> will get total information on commit

merge stratagies
----------------

1.Merge
--------------
When you merge one branch with another branch
main <- feature1
It will create a merge commit always have 2 parents
merge will preserve the complete history, It is like a chain structure

2.Rebase
---------
no extra commit
commit ids will change rewrites history
it will not preserve history
it look like a linear development happend in main branch

Squash
----------
mixing all the commits into single commit

if a feature is develped by multiple developers then we use merge
rebase is used when there is only one developer

Branching strategy
--------------------
main
apart from main --> anything is called as feature
main is long lived branch, feature is short lived branch
developers create feature branches, 
do development on feature branches , 
once they complete the development they create Pull Request into main branch
use merge/rebase into main branch
