- so infratstructure is consitent in all environments

Cost Optimization

- create when required 
- stop or delete when not required 

automatic dependency management
----------------------
- we can create resources and terraform will take care of dependency mangement

modules

- you can create terraform code as modules, other projects can use it without writing from scratch.

Automated Infra
-------
CRUD
- create
- update
- read
- delete

version control
------------------
- if you keep code in git, we can maintain history and we can get back to previous versions

Inventory Mangement
